     My name is Tyler Rasmussen, also sometimes known as "Rasmatazz" among many other aliases.  You've reached my personal blog and portfolio - a place for me to share the many unique projects I work on as well as
     my personal insights into numerous topics.  You'll find a wide variety of posts here ranging from the realm of technology to the creative arts - no two posts are often alike and my interests vary often.
     There's a little something for everyone here - regardless of whether you're a passing visitor, someone looking to collaborate on a creative project, or someone seeking to connect professionally.  Whatever the reason,
     I hope you find something enjoyable or worthwhile during your visit.  If you're looking for additional content, feel free to check out my other social media handles.  Thanks for stopping by and enjoy!
